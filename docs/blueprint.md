# **App Name**: ShopSphere

## Core Features:

- Multiple List Management: Create and manage multiple shopping lists for different stores (e.g., supermarket, hardware store).
- Simple Item Entry: Add simple text-based items to specific shopping lists.
- Item Completion Tracking: Mark items as purchased directly within each list.
- Manual item reordering: Allow reordering of the shopping list items based on preference.
- Dual List System: Each store has two lists: 'Regular' items (re-selectable from recent list) and 'One-Off' items (disappear when ticked off).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#77B5FE) to create a calm and organized feeling.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), very slightly tinged with the blue hue.
- Accent color: Light orange (#FFB347) for highlighting key actions and categories, as the analogous orange contrasts well against the soft blue background.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, as this offers a clean, modern look suitable for list management while ensuring readability for longer descriptions or notes.
- Use simple, recognizable icons for different categories of items or stores. Favor Material Design icons for consistency and clarity.
- Emphasize a clean and straightforward layout with clear visual separation between lists and items. Prioritize ease of navigation.
- Incorporate subtle animations for item additions or completion to provide engaging user feedback without being distracting.
